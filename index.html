            <h3>WHO AM I ..?</h3>
            <p>I’m a computer engineering graduate.
                I love programming and I'm so passionate about my field of study,
                Therefore I managed to do a few related tasks while I’m still studying.
                
                This is how I earned an experience in fields such as games development using “unity engine”.
                These tasks helped with polishing my skills,
                so I have good problem-solving manners. 
                
                I've dealt with many programming languages at different levels, starting with low-level languages like Assembly and ending with java language, 
                C#,C,python, and C++. 
                Some of these languages were used and learned separately by me
                The times I spent learning and developing my skills empowered me in this field.</p>

            <h2>WHY AM I APPLYING FOR THIS PROGRAM?</h2>
            <h3>
            <p>The journey so far was not smooth and clear all the time, the main issue that I couldn't get over till now is despite the capabilities that I have gained, it wasn't enough 
                to get a job ,so I'm joining Code Academy hoping that it could give me the suitable skills and guide me to catch the right opportunities which will help me to build a
                 good CV and successful life and make some connections in that field.</p>
